# hyperbolic wythoff construction

a toolkit to draw uniform tilings in hyperbolic plane by wythoff construction.

The algoritm was based on [User:Tamfang's program](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/User:Tamfang/programs) on Wikipedia.
We revised the original program to support the following features:

* consolate several parts on that page into a single program
* vectorization for faster execution
* color customization
